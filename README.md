This project along with [flasher xml slideshow](https://github.com/foo123/flasher) were initiated some years back,
in order to create a generic slideshow framework based on flash for mostly work and demo purposes

This project and (flasher) are still in progress (fully working nevertheless), but not developed anymore.
